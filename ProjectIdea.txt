This is the project idea file and will contain the stuff that needs to be implemented in order to make a paint project where people draw and put lines and stuff, since we already get access to the 2d Context of the canvas element,
first I will implement on top of it and then Let's see what can we do..

Ideas to implement
    Line drawing with mouse movement
    tool picker , color picker

Since I cannot find the images for tools I will just make them a button with event listner attached

There is one approac i am thinking on how to implement the undo operation,
we draw this action to the last action

and if it is already drawn no need to , just stop .. so we draw everything recursively..
